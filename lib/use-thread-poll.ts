/**
 * Adaptive polling, in place of a socket.
 *
 * There is no realtime transport in this stack and adding one — a long-lived
 * connection, a fan-out between API instances — would be a large piece of
 * infrastructure for a shop that has one person answering messages. A poll is
 * the honest size of the problem. What makes it cheap enough is that it is
 * *adaptive*: a focused tab asks every few seconds, a blurred one backs off, and
 * a hidden one stops entirely. A tab left open overnight costs nothing.
 *
 * The cursor is the newest message id the client holds. Because ids are ULIDs
 * the server can answer "everything after this" exactly, so a poll that finds
 * nothing new transfers a few bytes rather than the whole thread. That is what
 * makes this affordable on the connections this audience actually has.
 *
 * The admin holds a near-identical copy. They are separate repositories and
 * `@buildkart/contract` carries types and schemas only — no React — so the
 * duplication is the cost of that boundary rather than an oversight.
